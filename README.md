Hello! I am Alicia Sanders. I have been working in website development for over 3 years in Raleigh, North Carolina, mostly on small business websites with a focus on user experience, conversions, and search engine optimization (SEO). I enjoy a job that continually challenges and teaches me new things every day, from exciting custom projects to managing hosting for dozens of websites.

My recent work has centered around WordPress development, including projects such as integrating with external APIs for CRMs and email newsletters, implementing product catalogs and eCommerce, building out front end product customizers, and much more. Beyond that my interests also include React, .NET, and web development in general.
